# Lu Chiang's Portfolio

Hi! I am Lu ðŸ‘‹

I am a **QA/Automation enthusiast** with hands-on experience in **Python, Selenium, Playwright, and API testing.** 
I have experience building end-to-end automated tests, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and integrating test cases with Jira for real-world workflow management.  

This repository summarises my projects, demonstrating my skills in test automation, API testing, and process-driven QA practices. Each project includes a brief overview, tech stack, key highlights, and links to the full code. ðŸ˜„
